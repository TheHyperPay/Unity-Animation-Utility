## üìëAbstract
Commonly, when you want to make object movements, you'll use the animation system(such as an animation clip, animator, etc.) in the Unity program. But, the animation system(built-in Unity engine) is hard to maintain. Because, when you have to change the movement of an animation by a game planner or another teammate, you have to modify the figures one by one. Furthermore, It can change very awkward to handle values related to physics. 

That's why I make these scripts. It has made it easy for programmers to implement the following UI animations.

## üéôÔ∏èIntroduce
This project's goal is to emboding UI movement by C# scripts.

Below, there are references to implementing UI action tasks.
